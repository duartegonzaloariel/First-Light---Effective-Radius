# FirstLight-EffectiveRadius
## Description üèù

The main objective of this work is to study the ‚Äúeffective radius ‚Äì mass‚Äù relationship of a set of cosmological simulations using FL zoom-in. A second objective is to study the evolution of particular galaxies as a function of z. Also, it is of interest to study the star formation rate (SFR) and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and their relationship with the effective radius, although these properties (SFR and sSFR) have already been studied by FL previously.

## Installation and Recommendations
This project requires the installation of a platform like Spider to be able to execute Python code.
On the other hand, there is only one "demo" folder that contains the files FL640_S015.a0.090, FL658_S014.a0.090 and FL661_S012.a0.090. There is a larger database with more simulated galaxies belonging to FirstLight. You can contact me to ask me to put you in touch with the research group.
